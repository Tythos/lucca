The “Library of Utilities for C/C++ Astrodynamics” (LUCCA) is an open-source (MIT license) collection of methods and classes for solving both common and complex problems in aerospace engineering. It is designed and written in C/C++ for fast execution and near-universal platform support. Problems include a variety of propagation models, orbit determination, kinematics, launch models, and orbital controllers.
